## introduction
It is an AR project with vuforia and unity3d on the frontend and TensorFlow on the backend. When you stay on an object it automatically captures the screen and sends the image to the backend. The backend parses, recognizes the object, and returns json data. The frontend displays the data in the form of AR around the target object.
